         <h1>My Destiny Trip</h1>

         <h2>The Beginning</h2>

<p>I consider myself a gamer, ok let's be clear here, not a hardcore, striming, super duper gamer, just a casual very dedicated gamer. Sometimes life gets in the way and I stop gaming for a while, but sooner or later I come back to it.<\
br>
  And so it happened that once upon a time, after finishing "God of War 4", I found myself with nothing to play. I'm old school and like to buy my games in physical format, so around november 2018 I was waiting for some games that were 
supposed to be Christmas's presents to myself, the only problem was there were still two month to go before Christmas.</p>

        <h2>The Search</h2>
 <p>I went looking into my son's games for something to pass the time. The options were kind of limited, they went from the first Call of Duty to the last and that was it, except...there they were: Destiny and Destiny 2.<br>

  I remembered my son telling me when we bought Destiny, condescendingly - <em>You won't like Destiny, mom. It's an FPS like COD</em> - but seeing there weren't other options I took Destiny with me and went to play.</p>

          <h3>Destiny</h3>
<p>  My favorites games being Skyrim, Assasins Creed (all except the last two)and Horizon: Zero Dawn, Destiny baffled me. Beside it being my first online game I was like - <em>Where is the story?!</em> - All the same I found it challeng
ing and wanted to get good at it. By December 18 I gave up. There weren't enough people playing, I was always doing strikes alone, I was getting nowhere! So back to the shelf it went and I picked...</p>

<h3>Destiny 2</h3>

  So...Destiny 2...It has a story!<br>
  Ok, I know it's short, but it's a story nontheless.<br>

I ran the campaign, some strikes, got some exotics and...again my son's voice, despectively - <em>It's an online game mom! You need friends to play it. And you have <strong>no</strong> friends</em> - (insert a silent tear here)<br>
So...next step:</p>


<h2>Finding Friends</h2>
