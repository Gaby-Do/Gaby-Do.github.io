           <h1>Living the Pandemic</h1>

           <h2>March 2020 - The Beginning of the End</h2>


    <p>For us it all began with a posh wedding, some lady came from Europe and decided to go partying with 500 other people. She tested positive and a couple days later so did some people she partied with.<br>
      By March 15th we were all in a panic. Restaurants, malls and theaters began to close. And that is how I lost my job.</p>

    <h2>Holding Pattern</h2>

    <p>For me surviving the pandemic wasn't just about COVID, wasn't just about flattening the curve, about not getting infected or getting your health back in case you did. It was more about being couped 24/7 with my family, about losi
ng my job and not finding a new one, about not seeing friends nor parents nor siblings.<br>

      At first, I guess I thought it was going to be here and gone in a couple of weeks, a month tops...so I sat at home and waited for normality to come back...and waited...and waited.<br>

      Two months later I was still there, still without a job, still without a paycheck, and normality still far away. At a time in my life when I thought my future was secure I found myself suddenly jobless and I felt totally lost.<br>

      More than a year later I've forgotten how many CVs I've sent, how many job sites I've registered to, and I'm still jobless, still at home, still waiting...and going crazier by the moment.<br>

      The only thing helping me cling to sanity is a <a href="http://52.73.92.20/tweets.html" target="_blank"><strong>game</strong></a>.</p>

    <h2>July 2021 - Recalculating...</h2>

   <p>By now I've spent so much time without going outside that I'm beginning to forget what the real world looks like.
    I've been so long without a job that I'm beginning to belive that I'm indeed useless.
    I need a way out, a game is not enough anymore.</p>

    <h2>Waking Up</h2>

    <h3>- A Friend's Words</h3>
    <p><em>Stop looking for an accounting job, you can do anything!</em></p>


    <h3>- A Friend's email</h3>
    <p><em>Hey Gaby! Got this email, why don't you take a look at it?</em></p>

    <h3>- Maybe a New Beginning...</h3>
